# Second Milestone Project Newworldsalon

**Project's Name – Newworldsalon**

Newworldsalon is a personal real-life project that I intend to start-up by December 2020. It is a beauty shop located in the heart of Stockholm. The goal is to redefine the outer beauty that brings out the inner beauty in our clients by meeting the needs of people. A place were men, women and children can have a fresh hair cut and styles. The salon provides different services that could help satisfy clients beauty and looks. 

**A brief project method:**

As mentioned earlier the aim of the project is to help promote cleanliness, healthy and smart look. Looking refreshed attracts good companies. My passion is driven from my love for hair, make-up, looking clean and good. As the saying goes “Cleanliness is next to godliness”. Also is my passion to see people looking nice and presentable for work, meetings and  social life. I feel starting up a salon will give me a platform help contribute to healthy living and longer life span. 

After going through my first milestone project and JS, I have gathered some knowledge on how to design a simple website like this. I have also watched lots of tutorials and got the section designs from looking at different Salon website sites. Further details about the project are given below.

   Every link takes you to the right sections. The home page keeps the user on the first section since it is the homepage. Though I am aware the homepage on the navbar could be deleted since it takes the user no 
   where other than the first page that could be seen already. The reason why is there is to let them know that is the Homepage. Every sections have been tested to ensure they all work well as intended.
